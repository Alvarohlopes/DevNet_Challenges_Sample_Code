# Challenge

You are developing your latest Industrial IoT project and are in need of a service to connect your data backend.  You know your customers are super sensitive about security and are also wanting to be assured that the service you are using for your product is secure.  You know your industrial and commerical customers are familiar with Cisco products and like Cisco's committment to security.  You decide to use Cisco's new IoTDC service to connect your data for peace of mind for your Cisco account.  

You also want to promote secure message alerting for your IoT data and decide to also connect Cisco Spark, for end to end encryption, to IoTDC to process the data looking for specific alerts and then message your client when specific data is detected.

Use your IoT demo kit, connect to Ciscoâ€™s IoTDC data service and process your data securely.  Then connect your IoTDC data stream to Cisco Spark messaging service for alerts secured by end to end encryption.
